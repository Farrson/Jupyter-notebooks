# Fashion-MNIST
This is a dataset provided by Zalando (online retailer) containing 28x28 images of different cloths. The images are separated into 10 different classes and the dataset requires no further handling. The dataset can be obtained on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) or here on github (https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). 
The notebook displays my results using a CNN, which achieved an accuracy of 88.5 percent on the test data.
